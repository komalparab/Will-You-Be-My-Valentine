        My Love Abhishek 💖,<br><br>
        From the moment you walked into my life, everything started feeling brighter and more meaningful. 
        You didn’t just become part of my world — you became my world.  
        The way you smile, the way you care, the way you simply exist… it makes my heart feel full.
        <br><br>
        Loving you feels peaceful, warm, and right.

        My Safe Place 💕,<br><br>
        With you, I feel understood without explaining too much. 
        I feel comfort without asking for it.  
        You are my calm during chaos and my happiness on difficult days.
        <br><br>
        Every laugh, every late-night talk, every moment with you means more than you know.
